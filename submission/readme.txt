This was implemented using the same mouse input detection as for rotation, and the input x and y were projected to the
camera's up and right vector, then the eye and the look at were translated and the view matrix was calculated.

NOTE: In Task 1, the program was not shut down in the completely right way, (not everything was terminated/closed/deleted),
this should now be fixed for Task 2.
